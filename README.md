# tempi

tempi is simple Haskell library for representing and working with musical tempo. Tempo is represented as a data structure with three orthogonal components (a frequency, a time, and a count that, notionally, increases as time passes).

The main purpose of the library is to allow various Haskell-based live coding languages to share a common representation of tempo and some functions over that representation, instead of constantly reinventing the wheel.

See hackage or the source code for documentation.

Released under the 3-clause BSD license. Further contributions welcome (eg. additional useful functions on the basis of this basic representation of tempo)!
